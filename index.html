	You want the years? Go to LinkedIn.

	Should include Upstart, in the about or details section?

	Details should be 'LinkedIn', 'Twitter' and grow to include '&highlight' and written blog.

	NEA Studio could be described in the 'about' section. Maybe just the shortest of shout outs.

	Should I include Github? Yes, I stand by this decision. It says, 'hey, I can code enough that I can openly say I do.' It could directly link to matthewkulp.com github page, just because it's the most advanced thing I've built. I could also load a bunch of Framer files on there. In the future, I could version control Framer mock-ups this way

	What is the language one uses to describe being a product manager? Look at Brett for how he describes his IFTTT experience. Find some writing in the product manager's handbook. What are those keywords that should be included to get someone hooked?

	What is a good format for the descriptions on the carousel?
	I think it's like this: (1) Title, (2)Role, (3a)The product one-liner. (3b) If no product one-liner because it's not the first image of that product. Write something pertinent about the (i) the image or (ii) the project.
	That means, very quickly, we get a project name and a summation of my skills (assuming that a title like 'product design' says something about skills. It's really not specific. What's the alternative? 'proficient in photoshop'? Surely, I'm past that with my work and it mustn't be important.. Alonzo Felix doesn't go into it- he let's his work speak for itself. And besides I don't want to work for anyone looking for a checklist of design tools. No one gets to dictate my tools. It's my craft afterall.

	How long should a description be?
	- 4 lines
	~ 202 characters per description.

	Really long about section, definitely not cutting it. I'm thinking one paragraph is really good. Let's figure out how many characters.
	- 8 lines
	~ 394 characters for 'intro'

	The background from the National Field photo makes me stop everytime, it makes the layout pop and look sensational. Try using a similar technique on the screenshots of mobile phones. Shortwave, could have that photo of people with listening devices or that photo of a bunch of people on a train not paying attention to each other. Tasting Room could have an image of wine fields looking insanely gorgeous from outer space.
	Hashtag could have some bitching protests in the background.

					<!-- My name is Matthew Kulp. I am concise and precise. Approach products holistically. Comfortable leading, managing and direction. But good at every stage and that's why I'm killer in small to mid-sized organizations where I get alot of responsibility and opportunities to lead. Co-founder, Principal and Lead Designer of Mountain Lab, an emergent product design consultancy. I have a degree in Furniture Designer from RISD. I got into tech through politics. I'm an Upstart. Worked with NEA Design Studio. I’m a full-stack designer, regularly designing & managing all stages of the products I work on. Don't believe me? Check out Shortwave, Hashtag, Movie Night, Podcast Foo.
					<p> -->
					I thrive on small to mid-sized teams. I love to lead, delegate, manage, support great design at all levels of a project. I know how to prioritize product design like a motherfucker and don't let unimportant details distract nor do I let them get lost. Often, that's the challenge, their isn't enough time. Here is a little more text to push it over. One more line and a little bit to make it full. Done.
					<!-- <p>
					How do you achieve great design and move fast? You run cycles that ask questions (engineer led cycles), and then you run cycles where you refine the answers and prune the dead branches (design led cycles). I got ideas, yo and I want to enact them. -->
